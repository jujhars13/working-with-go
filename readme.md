## View online at: https://mkaz.blog/working-with-go/

Working with Go is a set of examples for Go (golang) to help an experienced programmer become familiar with the Go language. Go is often referred to as golang to help searches.


## Resources

This set of examples assumes a base level of programming experience and is intended for someone learning the Go language from another language; not necessarily someone new to programming altogether.

If you are starting out and want to learn how to program and choose Go as your first language, check out [Learn Programming in Go](http://www.golang-book.com/)

The official site has a [Tour of Go](http://tour.golang.org/) which is an interactive walk through, another good introduction to the language.

I'm also a big fan of [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) which is quite similar.
